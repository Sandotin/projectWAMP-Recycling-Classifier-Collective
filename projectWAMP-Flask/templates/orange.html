    		If you have a yard, food scraps can be added to a compost pile outdoors along with other organic waste.  You can make compost by following the given steps:
    		<ul class='text-container'>
    			<li>
    				Combine brown and green items:
					Dried leaves, cardboard, newspaper are brown items that you can mix with plants and animals.
				</li>
				<li>
					Water your pile:
					Sprinkle water on your pile but donâ€™t water it too much otherwise the microorganisms in the pile will become waterlogged.
				</li>
				<li>
					Stir your pile:
					You should provide the pile with oxygen by turning it once a week with a garden fork. The best time to turn the compost is when the center of the pile feels warm.
				</li>
				<li>
					Feed your Garden:
					When the compost no longer gives off heat and becomes dry, brown, and crumbly, it's fully cooked and ready for your garden.
				</li>  
    		</ul>
